ü§ñ Tiny AI Q&A Bot: Mistral-Powered Streamlit App
Project Overview
This project successfully implements the AI Q&A Bot task from the intern assignment, extending it to meet the Stretch Goal of providing a functional, modern user interface.

The application uses the state-of-the-art Mistral-7B-Instruct model via the Hugging Face API, wrapped in a user-friendly Streamlit web interface. It serves as a simple, powerful demonstration of connecting a front-end application to a large language model.
